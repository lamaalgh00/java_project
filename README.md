# OOP 1 project
The project is an airline reservation system 'Java' that includes 4 classes with a main class. The output is a menu containing 3 choices: "Book the flight", "Display the ticket", and "Exit".

When choosing "Book the flight", the system will ask for information about the guest, including their name, age, and whether they are a UJ student. It will also ask for the departure and destination locations, the preferred cabin, day, time, and seat. If the guest is a UJ student, a discount will be applied.

Choosing "Display the ticket" will show the information that has been entered for the reservation.
